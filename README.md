# Object Detection for Visually Impaired People

## Introduction

Vision impairment is one of the top disabilities globally, affecting millions of people worldwide. Visually impaired individuals face numerous challenges in their daily lives, including difficulty identifying objects around them and navigating their surroundings. This project aims to develop an object detection application to assist visually impaired people in navigating their surroundings and identifying objects of interest.

### Project Overview

The proposed application will utilize deep learning algorithms for object detection and distance estimation. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture will be trained using predefined datasets from TensorFlow to identify objects in real-time. Image segmentation and image recognition techniques will be employed to enhance the accuracy of object detection.

### Proposed Solution

The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Collect and preprocess a dataset of images containing various objects.

2. **Model Training:** Train a CNN model using the preprocessed dataset to identify and classify objects.

3. **Mobile Application Development:** Develop a mobile application that integrates with the camera and audio drivers.

4. **Object Detection and Distance Estimation:** Implement object detection and distance estimation functionalities using the trained CNN model.

5. **Voice Output Integration:** Enable voice output to communicate object detection results and distance information to the user.

### Benefits

The proposed object detection application offers several benefits to visually impaired individuals:

* **Enhanced Mobility and Navigation:** Assistance in identifying objects and navigating surroundings safely and independently.

* **Increased Confidence and Independence:** Empowerment to perform daily tasks with greater confidence and self-reliance.

* **Improved Quality of Life:** Overall enhancement in the quality of life and independence for visually impaired individuals.

### Impact

The successful development and implementation of this object detection application can significantly improve the lives of visually impaired individuals by providing them with the ability to navigate their surroundings more effectively and identify objects of interest. This technology has the potential to enhance their daily activities, increase their independence, and improve their overall quality of life.
